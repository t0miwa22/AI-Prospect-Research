Overview

This project is a Streamlit web application designed to generate tailored sales prospect articles. It scrapes a company's website, extracts relevant information, and uses OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini model to create insightful articles. These articles help the sales team better understand the company's business activities and align sales strategies accordingly.
Features

    Website Scraping:
        Uses BeautifulSoup to extract text content (<p> tags) from a given company URL.

    Summarization with OpenAI:
        Utilizes LangChainâ€™s LLMChain with a predefined prompt to generate detailed articles based on the scraped website content.

    Streamlit UI:
        Provides a simple and interactive interface to input a company URL and view the generated sales article.

    Agent-Oriented Design:
        Implements LangChain's tools and ReAct agent framework for modularity and extensibility.
